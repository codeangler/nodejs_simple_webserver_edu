### Perptual Learning
I learn best by working on real projects. Doing this I not only work through the logic of the build, I see the process of building. It is not something then that I've just read, or thought about doing. I've built this app. The ideas and steps for these builds are not my own. Following along, I write every line of code until the project works.
